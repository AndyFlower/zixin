### Chapter 1 The Bennets' new neighbour

It is a truth well known to all the world that an unmarried man in possession of a large fortune must be in need of a wife. And when such a man moves into a neighbourhood ,even if nothing is known about his feelings or opinions, this truth is so clear to the surrounding families,that they think of him immediately as the future husband of one or other of their daughters.

> 凡是有财产的单身汉，必定需要娶位太太，这已经成了一条举世公认的真理。这样的单身汉，每逢搬到一个地方，四邻八舍虽然完全不了解他的性情如何，见解如何，可是，既然这样的一条真理早已在人们心目中根深蒂固，因此人们总是把它看做自己某一个女儿理所应当的一笔财产。

'My dear Mr Bennet',said  his lady to him   one day,'have you heard that someone is going to rent Netherfield Park at  last?'

> 有一天，班纳特太太对他的丈夫说：“我的好姥爷，尼日斐花园终于租出去了，你听说过没有”

Mr.Bennet replied that he had not.

> 班纳特先生回答道，他没有听说过。

"But it is,”returned she;“for Mrs. Long has just been here,and she told me all about it.”

> "的确租出去了"她说，"朗格太太刚刚上来过这儿，她把整件事的底细，一五一十得都告诉了我。"

Mr.Bennet made no answer.

> 班纳特先生没有理睬她

“Do you not want to know who has taken it?”cried his wife impatiently.

> "你难道不想知道是谁租去的吗？"太太不耐烦的嚷起来了

“You want to tell me,and I have no objection to hearing it.”

> "既是你要说给我听，我听听也无妨。"

This was invitation enough.

> 这句话足够鼓励她讲下去了

“Why,my dear,you must know,Mrs.Long saysthat Netherfield is taken by a young man oflarge fortune from the north of England;thathe came down on Monday in a chaise andfour to see the place,and was so muchdelighted with it,that he agreed withMr.Morris immediately;that he is to takepossession before Michaelmas,and some ofhis servants are to be in the house by the endof next week.”

> "哦，亲爱的，你得知道，朗格太太说，租尼日斐花园的是个阔少爷，它是英格兰北部的人；听说他星期一那天，乘着一辆驷马大轿车来看房子，看的非常中意，当场就和莫里斯先生谈妥了；他要在‘米迦勒节’以前搬进来，打算下个周末先叫几个佣人来住。"

“What is his name?”

> "这个人叫什么名字"

“Bingley.”

> "宾格莱"

“Is he married or single?”

> "结婚了还是单身？"

“Oh!Single,my dear,to be sure!A single manof large fortune;four or five thousand ayear.What a fine thing for our girls!”

> ”噢！是个单身，亲爱的，的的确确是个单身汉！一个有钱的单身汉；每年有四五千镑的收入。真是女儿们的福气！“

“How so?How can it affect them?”

> "这怎么说？关女儿们什么事？"

“My dear Mr. Bennet,”replied his wife,“how can you be so tiresome!You must know that I am thinking of his marrying one of them.”

> "我的好老爷，"太太回答道，"你怎么这样叫人讨厌！告诉你吧，我正在盘算，他要是挑中我们一个女儿做老婆，可多好！"

“Is that his design in settling here?”

> “他住到这儿来，就是为了这个打算吗？”

“Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely that he may fall in love with one of them,and therefore you must visit him as soon as he comes.”

> "打算！ 胡扯，这是哪儿的话！不过，他倒是兴许看中我们的某一个女儿呢，他一搬来，不就得去拜访他"

“I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go,or you may send them by themselves,which perhaps will be still better,for as you are as handsome as any of them,Mr. Bingley may like you the best of the party.”

“My dear, you flatter me. I certainly have had my share of beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now. When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty.”

“In such cases,a woman has not often much beauty to think of.”

“But,my dear,you must indeed go and see Mr.Bingley when he comes into the neighbourhood.”

“It is more than I engage for,I assure you.”

“But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you know,they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go,for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not.”

“You are over-scrupulous,surely. I dare say Mr.Bingley will be very glad to see you;and I will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying which ever he chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my little Lizzy.”

“I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better than the others;and I am sureshe is not half so handsome as Jane,nor halfso good-humoured as Lydia.But you arealways giving her the preference.”

“They have none of them much torecommend them,”replied he;“they are allsilly and ignorant like other girls;but Lizzy hassomething more of quickness than hersisters.”

“Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your ownchildren in such a way?You take delight invexing me.You have no compassion for mypoor nerves.”

“You mistake me,my dear.I have a highrespect for your nerves. They are my oldfriends. I have heard you mention them withconsideration these last twenty years atleast.”

“Ah,you do not know what I suffer.”

“But I hope you will get over it,and live tosee many young men of four thousand a yearcome into the neighbourhood.”

“It will be no use to us, if twenty such shouldcome,since you will not visit them.”

“Depend upon it, my dear, that when thereare twenty,I will visit them all.”

Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quickparts,sarcastic humour,reserve,and caprice,that the experience of three-and-twenty yearshad been insufficient to make his wifeunderstand his character.Her mind was lessdifficult to develop.She was a woman of meanunderstanding, little information, anduncertain temper.When she wasdiscontented,she fancied herself nervous.Thebusiness of her life was to get her daughtersmarried;its solace was visiting and news.
